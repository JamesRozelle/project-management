# Livepeer Project Proposals

Issues in this repo include suggestions for projects to be built on Livepeer. This encompasses:

* Decentralized Applications (DApps)
* Video features
* P2P Networking and content delivery
* Protocol upgrades
* Open source contributions to other projects that relate to Livepeer

Feel free to add any ideas, suggestions, comments, or begin collaborating on an open idea [in the issues](https://github.com/livepeer/project-proposals/issues). There is some organization of these issues in a [project view here](https://github.com/orgs/livepeer/projects/1).
