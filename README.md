# Livepeer Project Management

This repository contains issues and projects relating to organizing
and visualizing:

* The high level Livepeer roadmap
* Project proposals
* How we work together as an open, global project

This is meant as an open community forum, so feel free to comment on
issues, ask questions, and create project proposals.

## Community Roadmap

The roadmap is captured in
[The Roadmap Project](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/projects/2)
within this repo.

It is inteded to present the highest level view possible of what the
most immediate goals are, what's being worked on, what is coming
next,and the most urgent blockers that are preventing
forward progress.

Individual implementation issues are captured within module specific repositories.

## Community Project Proposals

Issues in this repo organized into the project proposals project include suggestions for projects to be built on Livepeer. This encompasses:

* Decentralized Applications (DApps)
* Video features
* P2P Networking and content delivery
* Protocol upgrades
* Open source contributions to other projects that relate to Livepeer

Feel free to add any ideas, suggestions, comments, or begin collaborating on an open idea [in the issues](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/issues). There is some organization of these issues in a [project view here](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/projects/1).

## How We Work

Livepeer has team members, contributors, and community members all
over the world. We use the following practices to ensure that no
matter where a community member is, or how they want to get involved,
they can participate in an effective and inclusive way.

### Bi-weekly Open Community Calls

Every other week we try to host a community call. The schedule,
agenda, and roles are tracked in
[issues in this repo](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/issues). The
calls are open to all, live streamed, and anyone is encouraged to
comment on the planning issue to add to the
agenda.

[View a previous planning issue](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/issues/30). 

The calls are an opportunity to get a glimpse into the current
priorities, and to ask questions and discuss ideas. They are capped at
60 minutes max, and notes are shared on the issue following the call.

### High level development priorities

These are captured in the
[The Roadmap Project](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/projects/2)
as described above. These are the most important goals that the team
is running at, and are revisited on roughly a quarterly cadence.

### Project based organization

There are a number of components in the Livepeer ecosystem. Even
though they all need to be maintained, fixed, updated, and improved,
work is not necessarily organized around a specific
component. Instead, it is generally organized around the concept of a
**project**, with a defined goal and known team members who are
focused on hitting the goal.

The active projects can be found in the high level roadmap listed
above.

Each active project has a room in our
[gitter chat](https://gitter.im/livepeer) for daily standup updates
and coordination.

### Weekly development sprints

Each week there is a Monday engineering planning meeting where we:

1. Look back at the goals and deliverables for the previous week for
   each of the product and hold ourselves accountable to whether or
   not we delivered.
2. Set goals for the current week and take ownership of deliverables
within each project.

Team members are expected to come prepared to this meeting, knowing
what they would like to accomplish during the week.

### Daily virtual standup

Each morning team members on a given project are expected to post a
brief virtual standup to the project's status update chat room on
Gitter. The format is:

* **Date**
* **What I did yesterday**
* **What I'm doing today**
* **Blockers if any**

### Github based communication

Team members are encouraged to use Github issues and Github projects
to overshare their thoughts, ideas, tasks, and issues. File issues for
each task worked on or feature change no matter how small and self
contained.

Likewise, other collaborators are encouraged to triage these issues
(closing them if necessary after responding), and potentially organize
them into projects in order to aid in prioritization.

### Prioritization

Livepeer level prioritization is expected to take place in the
high level roadmap shared above. Individual issues in sub projects are
tricker to prioritize.

Team members are encouraged to use Github projects and milestones within individual
repositories to prioritize issues contained within that
repository. It's recommended to use the "To-do", "In Progress", "Done"
columns at the minimum.

The weekly engineering planning meeting is a good time to get feedback
on and share the prioritization. But it's also a good idea to ask for
some discussion any time priorities are in question.

### A note on decentralization

While the above is meant to help people understand how to get involved
in the project and how to fit in the workflow, it's important to
remember that Livepeer is a decentralized, permissionless
project. **This means you are empowered to build what you want to see
exist, and no permission is necessary.**

If you have questions about how to make an impact or contribution to
Livepeer, stop by the
[gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/livepeer/Lobby) and say hello.
