# Livepeer Project Management

This repository contains issues and projects relating to organizing
and visualizing:

* The high level Livepeer roadmap
* Project proposals

This is meant as an open community forum, so feel free to comment on
issues, ask questions, and create project proposals.

## Community Roadmap

The roadmap is captured in
[The Roadmap Project](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/projects/2)
within this repo.

It is inteded to present the highest level view possible of what the
most immediate goals are, what's being worked on, what is coming
next,and the most urgent blockers that are preventing
forward progress.

Individual implementation issues are captured within module specific repositories.

* Decentralized Applications (DApps)
* Video features
* P2P Networking and content delivery
* Protocol upgrades
* Open source contributions to other projects that relate to Livepeer

Feel free to add any ideas, suggestions, comments, or begin collaborating on an open idea [in the issues](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/issues). There is some organization of these issues in a [project view here](https://github.com/livepeer/project-management/projects/1).
